# Sales-Data-Analysis
Data Analytics Project
Overview:-
    This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Excel and Power BI. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights by cleaning the dataset, modeling the data, creating               measures, and building an interactive dashboard for analysis and decision-making.
Dataset:-
    The dataset was initially loaded and explored in Microsoft Excel.
    It contains structured tabular data used for analytical reporting.
    Basic data quality issues such as missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and incorrect data types were addressed during the cleaning phase.
Tools & Technologies:-
    Microsoft Excel – Initial data loading and inspection.
    Power BI Desktop – Data cleaning, modeling, analysis, and visualization.
    Power Query – Data transformation and preparation.
    DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures and calculations.
Project Steps:-
    1)Data Loading
          Imported the dataset into Excel for initial review.
          Loaded the data into Power BI for further processing.
    2)Data Cleaning
          Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
          Standardized column names and data formats.
          Ensured correct data types for analysis.
    3)Calendar Table Creation
          Created a custom calendar (date) table.
          Added columns such as Year, Month, Quarter, and Day.
          Marked the table as a Date Table in Power BI.
    4)Data Modeling
          Built relationships between the calendar table and Sales tables.
          Ensured a star schema for optimal performance and clarity.
    5)Measures Creation
          Created DAX measures for key metrics and KPIs.
          Used measures to support dynamic and accurate visualizations.
    6)Dashboard Development
          Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard.
          Added filters and slicers for better user exploration.
          Focused on clarity, usability, and business relevance.
Dashboards:-
    The Power BI dashboard provides:
          High-level KPI summaries.
          Trend analysis over time.
          Interactive filters for deeper insights.
          Clean and intuitive visual design.
Results & Insights:-
    Improved data quality and consistency through structured cleaning.
    Clear visibility into key metrics and performance trends.
    Interactive reporting that supports data-driven decision-making.
    Demonstrates strong skills in data preparation, modeling, and visualization.
How to Run the Project:-
    1)Download or clone this repository.
    2)Open the Power BI (.pbix) file using Power BI Desktop.
    3Ensure the dataset file path is correctly linked.
    4)Refresh the data if needed.
    5)Interact with the dashboard using slicers and filters.

Built relationships between the calendar table and fact tables.

Ensured a star schema for optimal performance and clarity.
